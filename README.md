# Sportdec frontend coding challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the coding challenge for developers interested in __frontend and mobile__ roles in Sportdec. It's not an against-the-clock time challenge - you can complete it at home in your own time. 

Ideally you will return your submission in __within 7 days__ - the sooner you get your submission back to us, the more quickly we can progress your application to interview stage.

## The Challenge
1. Create a website or mobile app that displays an overview of a real football match. 

> In this repo you'll find a JSON data file with some events that occurred during a typical match. You'll also find some assets you may want to use to create an interesting user experience.

## Instructions
While you're free to choose the technologies you wish to use to complete this challenge, submissions in React or React Native are preferred.

- Your solution should clearly depict the timeline of events in the match, providing users with the information they need in an usable way
- Your submission is for a development role, you won't be judged on (lack of) visual design ability
- We expect your submission to be production quality - __we leave it to your own judgement what this should entail__
- Include any instructions required to run your submission (in Markdown format)

## Deadline
- While there is no specific deadline, we request that you return your submission __within 7 days__
- We're more interested in how you approach and complete the challenge than how quickly

## Guidelines
- Do not include any private details with your submission. We suggest you make any private values such as API keys you may use configurable
- Publish your submission to Github as a repo, adding the following Sportdec team members as collaborators:
  - `@dereklawless`
  - `@onlydave`
  - `@joshhbk`
